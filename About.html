                        <br> <br> I primarily work remotely but I'm open to taking on projects locally too if they catch

                        I'm studying blockchain development remotely at Medieinstitutet, a two year programme that will
                        give me deep knowledge in both front-end and back-end blockchain development.

                        I am an avid crypto and DeFi enthusiast and like to get involved with different projects in this
                        area. I love the idea of a decentralized web and work towards that in every aspect that I can.
                        <br> <br> I'm a big proponent of sustainability and like to make use of blockchain technologies
                        to encourage sustainability.

                        fan of the outdoors and love to go hiking, climbing, skiing or going on whichever adventure that

                        <br> <br> I'm also a huge sports fan and all sports entice me, but maybe mostly Football. I also
                        enjoy to read and write, and I might publish a novel at some point in the future.

                        Before I started my journey into the world of blockchain I was involved in quite a few other
                        things. I have a master in Sustainable Urban Development and spent a few years in that area.
                        <br> <br> I've spent some time working in psychiatry. I've also studied business economics and
                        delved into investing and trading. My goal is to tap in to all these invaluable and widely
                        different experiences in my work with blockchain.
